    This page is set up using HTML with some styling from CSS.
    From there, I deployed my code to a remote server using Digital Ocean.
    I didn't have to set up a server.py file on my local machine, because Digital Ocean uses my code directly from 
    a GitHub repository.

    Our product is called Clean Sneaks, and its an automatic shoe cleaning device.
    The idea came to me when I was thinking about things that would make my life easier, and one thing was always buying
    new shoes instead of saving my dirty shoes.
    This IOT device will be compatible with some of the most popular shoe models including Jordans, Dr. Marten's, Yeezys, and various other types of shoes.
