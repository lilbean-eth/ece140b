      What is this page?
    </div>
    <br>
    This page is set up using HTML with some styling from CSS.
    From there, I deployed my code to a remote server using Digital Ocean.
    I didn't have to set up a server.py file on my local machine, because Digital Ocean uses my code directly from 
    a GitHub repository.

    </div>
    <br>
    Our product is called Clean Sneaks, and its an automatic shoe cleaning device.
    The idea came to me when I was thinking about things that would make my life easier, and one thing was always buying
    new shoes instead of saving my dirty shoes.
    This IOT device will be compatible with some of the most popular shoe models including Jordans, Dr. Marten's, Yeezys, and various other types of shoes.

      Home Page UX improvements
    </div>
    <br>
    This week I altered my homepage to decrease the amount of cognitive load that my user needs to exert when viewing my page.
    This first update was to center my Product and KVP links instead of having them located to the left.
    Next, I went ahead and added headers to each of my paragraphs so that the reader knows what they are reading before they start reading it.
    Lastly, I added another link to my products page by making the header for my product paragraph into a clickable link that routes the user to my Product page.

      Laws of UI Design example - Jakob's Law

    <br>
    One small example of Jakob's Law can be seen in the interface of old car radios and newer car entertainment centers. Back when I had a 2008 Toyota Corolla, I had to endure only having a 
    radio & CD interface, no auxilary cable or bluetooth connectivity. This radio's interface is pictured on the left.  I found myself getting use to the radio interface over the years, and learned that the long press on one of the numbered buttons
    would set that station into the number's "memory". Once I got a newer car, I had to learn the new entertainment interface, to my pleasure, I found that setting the station into memory was the same
    action, the long press.

    <br>
    An example of Doherty Threshold can be seen within the gaming community, and can especially be seen in the handheld emulator market as well as online gameplay. When a gamer notices that his/her 
    framerate is getting choppy, they will lose interest in playing that game. A smooth gameplay experience is very important in the gaming community, and without it you will lose users.

      Laws of UI Design example - Miller's Law
    </div>

    </div>
    <br>
    A nice example of Miller's law is email format etiqutte within the work place. Using chunks to separate ideas and actions helps lessen the cognitive load for the person you're emailing.
    See the image above for an example of this.
